Make 3 simple html pages for personal astronomical notes with the following content:
1. Home Page (index.html): list of personal notes with date and title
2. Note Page (note1.html): note date, title, and content
3. Create page (create.html): form to create a new note with fields for date, title, and content

Use bastc HTML structure separated css file and a simple JavaScript for same basic DOM animations.
Make only front-end code, no back-end or database integration.
Fill index.html with sample notes and note1.html with a sample note content. 

Pages design should be modern and realated to astronomy, using a dark theme without childish elements.
Use a simple and clean layout with a focus on readability. Do not use any external libraries or frameworks, only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
